# Frequent-Itemset-Mining-New-Approach
Implementation of the modified FP-Tree approach

##A novel approach for frequent item set mining
This netbeans project implementation of the approach that we developed as a part of our under-grad project. It is a
modified version of the FP-tree approach that is well known for frequent itemset mining. The main uses for this algorithm
are for market basket analysis. The algorithm takes as input a comma seperated file of transactions with new transaction on 
a new line. Also works for different support and confidence values.
